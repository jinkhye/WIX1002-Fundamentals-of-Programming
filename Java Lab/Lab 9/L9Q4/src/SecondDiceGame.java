/*
The second dice game allows the player to roll one dice each time. 
When the dice is 6, the player can roll one more time. 
However, if the player rolls 6 again in second attempt, the player
wonâ€™t have any score. Player that reaches 100 point wins the game. If the player
scores more than 100, the last score is not counted and the player needs to roll again
in next turn. Create a Tester class to test the program.
